This is a Prompt Repo. You can use the prompts in prompts folder directly. May be a langchain wrapper later on.

# Core concept
GPT-4 is pretty good at inteprating code, as shown in "sparks of artificial general intelligence early experiments with gpt-4" by Microsoft. And ***code is a much more efficient and precise way of transmitting information.*** So I proposed a cue for utilizing GPT-4 to execute pseudocode.

Also, GPT-4 or LLM can be treated as a super api provider. Apis that are too complex to construct can be implemented by a simple prompt. If so, writing traditional code with super apis with a chat window can be a new way of working.

# Prompt
Prompt can be found in [base prompt file](./prompts/base.md)

# Application
After input base prompt, you can write short code to do fun stuff. In my experience, here are some fun application scenarios:
- Make a POC demo by simply writing a short pseudo code.
- Finding some super apis for other components to call.
- Guide GPT to solve complex problems step by step, or should I say, statement by statement.
